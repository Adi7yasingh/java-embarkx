        Facts about while loop
        1.Condition in while loop should always be boolean, you will gwt compile time error if it's anything other than boolean.
        example while(true){} is valid
        but while(1){} is not valid because it is integer

        2.Curly braces for while loops are option. but if they are not used then the while loop can have 1 statement, and it should not be a declaration.
