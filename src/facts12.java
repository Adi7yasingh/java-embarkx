        Some facts about increment and decrement operators
        1. we can use increment and decrement operators only with variables, but not with constants.
        2. Nesting of increment and decrement operators is not allowed.
        3. We can use increment and decrement operators with normal variables, but nt with final variables.
        4. We cn apply increment and decrement operators for every primitive type but not with boolean(True;false)
